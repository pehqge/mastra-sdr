Things to consider:
- Comments and README should always be in English
- Whenever adding a function/tool/workflow/etc, add an explanatory comment in the agent's system prompt so it knows what to do with it and when to use it
- DO NOT generate a document at the end of the conversation about what was done

        Always consult Mastra documentation via MCP for:
        - Agent configuration (createAgent, system prompts, tools)
        - Workflow implementation (createWorkflow, steps, transitions)
        - Tool creation (createTool, parameters, execute)
        - Scorer configuration (for quality evaluation)

Things to consider:
- Comments and README should always be in English
- Whenever adding a function/tool/workflow/etc, add an explanatory comment in the agent's system prompt so it knows what to do with it and when to use it
- DO NOT generate a document at the end of the conversation about what was done
